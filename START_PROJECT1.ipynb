Here is an explanatory video by Huggingface of the [Decoders or autoregressive models](https://youtu.be/d_ixlCubqQw), not to be confused with the Encoders or autoencoding models. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided some starter code below and in `utils.py` that shows how we can load a pretrained large language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `utils.py` you will find a rudimentary class called `BaseAgent` with a class method called `memorize` that can be used to retrain (aka finetune) the model. This is not the best way to finetune, but it can be used as starter code to a new method that can finetune the model. \n",

Use special tokens like `<EMOTION_TYPE>` and `<|endoftext|>` to signify the difference between text and special outputs. \n",

The preprocessed dataset should be preprocessed in such a way that it can be used to retrain the large language model as an autoregressive sentiment classifier. For example, the model will be passed:\n",

    "`I am going on my second date with this guy that seems so far to really connect with me, I want to believe this is, you know, \"the one\".`\n",

    "`I am going on my third date with this person that seems, so far, to really connect with me. I want to believe this is ... you know ... \"the one\". <EMOTION_TYPE> hopeful <|endoftext|>`\n",
    "\n",
    "(You do NOT need to use all the data in the data folder for this project, you do not have to use a specific split of the data, just use enough data to accomplish your goals, and set aside the validation set so that it is valid according to the definition of a validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to use the starter code, it is written in PyTorch to give you full control of the training, but has some major features missing. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " a. you would have to edit it to allow different batch sizes. \n",
    " b. it does not keep track of the train and validation losses\n",
    " c. there is no early stopping or model saving built in\n",
    " \n",
    "You dont have to use the starter code, feel free to use the [huggingface functionality](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6?fw=pt)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make your preprocessing code clean, simple and easy to read and explain. Preferably with examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Answer this question: what is the majority classifier, aka [ZeroR (or Zero Rate)](https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-a-baseline-accuracy-for-a-classification-model-a4b342ceb88f), accuracy on the validation set that you set aside?\n",
    "\n",
    "explain how you calculated your answer\n",

    "\n",
    "Add an `evaluator` method that calculates the validation set accuracy, accuracy of predicting the correct emotion. While you are retraining the model, keep track of the validation and training losses for each epoch or each batch, output these 2 arrays of losses for plotting in the next step.
